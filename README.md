# N88 BASIC (De)compiler

## About

A commandline tool to decompile and compile N88 BASIC code for the PC88. This was developed for an English translation of Shin Taketori Monogatari for the PC88. The repository is located at [shin-taketori-monogatari-pc88-en](https://github.com/romh-acking/shin-taketori-monogatari-pc88-en).

This tool is a bit rough / unfinished and uses various hacks to preserve the datatypes of values.
